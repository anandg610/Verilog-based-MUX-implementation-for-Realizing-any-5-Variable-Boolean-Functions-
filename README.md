# Verilog-based-MUX-implementation-for-Realizing-any-5-Variable-Boolean-Functions-
 Successfully designed a 2n-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) through Verilog, achieving the implementation of generic 5-variable Boolean functions. â—¦ The project included both structural and behavioral Verilog implementations, employing elementary two-input logic gates for realization.
